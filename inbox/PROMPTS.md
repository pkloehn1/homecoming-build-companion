# Pre-generated extraction prompts

One ready-to-copy prompt per row in [CAPTURE_QUEUE.md](../../homecoming-build-companion/community/CAPTURE_QUEUE.md).

Workflow per row (full instructions in [CAPTURE_WORKFLOW.md](../tools/CAPTURE_WORKFLOW.md)):

1. Click the URL → opens forum thread in Chrome.
2. Open the Claude for Chrome side panel (extension icon, top right of Chrome).
3. Copy the prompt block below into the side panel chat → send.
4. Copy Claude's response (whole assistant message).
5. In PowerShell: `& "C:\Users\petek\repos\homecoming-build-companion\tools\capture.ps1" -Paste`

The prompt fills in the URL, today's date (2026-04-29), the topic tags, and trust level for that specific guide. Don't edit anything — paste verbatim.

Total in queue: **28** captures.

You're reading a Homecoming City of Heroes forum thread. Extract it into a
markdown file matching the format below.

IMPORTANT — multi-post guides. Many threads spread the guide across several
sequential posts by the same author (post 1: intro / table of contents,
post 2: section A, post 3: section B, ...). Walk the entire thread and
treat ALL posts by the original poster (and any users the OP explicitly
names as co-authors) as one continuous guide. Concatenate them in
chronological order, preserving the OP's section structure and headings.
If the OP edits a post over time, capture the latest version.

Replies from other users are community discussion. Include them only if
they materially correct, extend, or codify the guide content — and
attribute clearly ("as @user noted in reply 17, ..."). Skip flames,
signatures, brief praise, off-topic chatter.

# Frontmatter rules (apply to every emitted block below)
# - `trust:` is exactly one of: first-party, community-consensus, single-author-opinion.
#   Forum user-rank labels (Members, Retired Community Rep, etc.) are not valid trust values.
# - `authors:` is a single-line YAML array, e.g. [Bopper, tidge].
#   Single-line keeps the index parser happy.
# - All listed keys are required.

# Embedded builds — capture each as its own block

When the thread contains a complete build dump — a "Hero Plan" / "Villain Plan"
forum-export block, a [b]Hero Plan...[/b] BBCode block, or a DataLink URL —
extract it as a SEPARATE markdown block in the response, after the parent
capture. Each build is its own loadable artifact and gets its own file when
the user ingests, so it carries enough context to stand alone.

If the thread contains zero embedded builds, emit only the parent capture
and skip the per-build blocks entirely.

# Required output

Emit one PARENT capture block, immediately followed by zero or more BUILD
sub-capture blocks. Use the templates exactly. Output only fenced markdown
blocks, no other commentary.

> Trim with [...] inside long passages; preserve every section.

## Notable replies (only if materially additive)

- @user_name (date) — one-line summary of the contribution + verbatim excerpt.

## Build attachments

List every embedded build emitted in Block 2+ below, plus any unattached
build references (DataLink-only, .mxd attachments, etc.). When the thread
contains no embedded builds, the section is empty.

- <build title> — see Block <N> below — file: builds/<at>/<slug>.md — <archetype>, <primary>/<secondary>, <one-line summary>

You're reading a Homecoming City of Heroes forum thread. Extract it into a
markdown file matching the format below.

IMPORTANT — multi-post guides. Many threads spread the guide across several
sequential posts by the same author (post 1: intro / table of contents,
post 2: section A, post 3: section B, ...). Walk the entire thread and
treat ALL posts by the original poster (and any users the OP explicitly
names as co-authors) as one continuous guide. Concatenate them in
chronological order, preserving the OP's section structure and headings.
If the OP edits a post over time, capture the latest version.

Replies from other users are community discussion. Include them only if
they materially correct, extend, or codify the guide content — and
attribute clearly ("as @user noted in reply 17, ..."). Skip flames,
signatures, brief praise, off-topic chatter.

# Frontmatter rules (apply to every emitted block below)
# - `trust:` is exactly one of: first-party, community-consensus, single-author-opinion.
#   Forum user-rank labels (Members, Retired Community Rep, etc.) are not valid trust values.
# - `authors:` is a single-line YAML array, e.g. [Bopper, tidge].
#   Single-line keeps the index parser happy.
# - All listed keys are required.

# Embedded builds — capture each as its own block

When the thread contains a complete build dump — a "Hero Plan" / "Villain Plan"
forum-export block, a [b]Hero Plan...[/b] BBCode block, or a DataLink URL —
extract it as a SEPARATE markdown block in the response, after the parent
capture. Each build is its own loadable artifact and gets its own file when
the user ingests, so it carries enough context to stand alone.

If the thread contains zero embedded builds, emit only the parent capture
and skip the per-build blocks entirely.

# Required output

Emit one PARENT capture block, immediately followed by zero or more BUILD
sub-capture blocks. Use the templates exactly. Output only fenced markdown
blocks, no other commentary.

why it exists, what it's optimized for, when to use it. Pull the context
from the parent guide so this file reads cleanly on its own.

## Verbatim build

The complete forum-export block, BBCode and all, copied verbatim from the
post. Preserve the source formatting. The block speaks for itself; the user
pastes it into MidsReborn directly.

## DataLink

When the post includes a DataLink URL, paste it verbatim here. Omit the
section when no DataLink is posted.

## Notes from the author (if any)

Author commentary that accompanies the build in the same post, copied
verbatim. Omit the section when no author commentary is present.

You're reading a Homecoming City of Heroes forum thread. Extract it into a
markdown file matching the format below.

IMPORTANT — multi-post guides. Many threads spread the guide across several
sequential posts by the same author (post 1: intro / table of contents,
post 2: section A, post 3: section B, ...). Walk the entire thread and
treat ALL posts by the original poster (and any users the OP explicitly
names as co-authors) as one continuous guide. Concatenate them in
chronological order, preserving the OP's section structure and headings.
If the OP edits a post over time, capture the latest version.

Replies from other users are community discussion. Include them only if
they materially correct, extend, or codify the guide content — and
attribute clearly ("as @user noted in reply 17, ..."). Skip flames,
signatures, brief praise, off-topic chatter.

# Frontmatter rules (apply to every emitted block below)
# - `trust:` is exactly one of: first-party, community-consensus, single-author-opinion.
#   Forum user-rank labels (Members, Retired Community Rep, etc.) are not valid trust values.
# - `authors:` is a single-line YAML array, e.g. [Bopper, tidge].
#   Single-line keeps the index parser happy.
# - All listed keys are required.

# Embedded builds — capture each as its own block

When the thread contains a complete build dump — a "Hero Plan" / "Villain Plan"
forum-export block, a [b]Hero Plan...[/b] BBCode block, or a DataLink URL —
extract it as a SEPARATE markdown block in the response, after the parent
capture. Each build is its own loadable artifact and gets its own file when
the user ingests, so it carries enough context to stand alone.

If the thread contains zero embedded builds, emit only the parent capture
and skip the per-build blocks entirely.

# Required output

Emit one PARENT capture block, immediately followed by zero or more BUILD
sub-capture blocks. Use the templates exactly. Output only fenced markdown
blocks, no other commentary.

When the thread contains a complete build dump — a "Hero Plan" / "Villain Plan"
forum-export block, a [b]Hero Plan...[/b] BBCode block, or a DataLink URL —
extract it as a SEPARATE markdown block in the response, after the parent
capture. Each build is its own loadable artifact and gets its own file when
the user ingests, so it carries enough context to stand alone.

If the thread contains zero embedded builds, emit only the parent capture
and skip the per-build blocks entirely.

why it exists, what it's optimized for, when to use it. Pull the context
from the parent guide so this file reads cleanly on its own.

## Verbatim build

The complete forum-export block, BBCode and all, copied verbatim from the
post. Preserve the source formatting. The block speaks for itself; the user
pastes it into MidsReborn directly.

## DataLink

When the post includes a DataLink URL, paste it verbatim here. Omit the

## Notes from the author (if any)

Author commentary that accompanies the build in the same post, copied

You're reading a Homecoming City of Heroes forum thread. Extract it into a
markdown file matching the format below.

IMPORTANT — multi-post guides. Many threads spread the guide across several
sequential posts by the same author (post 1: intro / table of contents,
post 2: section A, post 3: section B, ...). Walk the entire thread and
treat ALL posts by the original poster (and any users the OP explicitly
names as co-authors) as one continuous guide. Concatenate them in
chronological order, preserving the OP's section structure and headings.
If the OP edits a post over time, capture the latest version.

Replies from other users are community discussion. Include them only if
they materially correct, extend, or codify the guide content — and
attribute clearly ("as @user noted in reply 17, ..."). Skip flames,
signatures, brief praise, off-topic chatter.

# Frontmatter rules (apply to every emitted block below)
# - `trust:` is exactly one of: first-party, community-consensus, single-author-opinion.
#   Forum user-rank labels (Members, Retired Community Rep, etc.) are not valid trust values.
# - `authors:` is a single-line YAML array, e.g. [Bopper, tidge].
#   Single-line keeps the index parser happy.

# Embedded builds — capture each as its own block

When the thread contains a complete build dump — a "Hero Plan" / "Villain Plan"
forum-export block, a [b]Hero Plan...[/b] BBCode block, or a DataLink URL —
extract it as a SEPARATE markdown block in the response, after the parent
capture. Each build is its own loadable artifact and gets its own file when
the user ingests, so it carries enough context to stand alone.

If the thread contains zero embedded builds, emit only the parent capture
and skip the per-build blocks entirely.

# Required output

Emit one PARENT capture block, immediately followed by zero or more BUILD
sub-capture blocks. Use the templates exactly. Output only fenced markdown
blocks, no other commentary.

You're reading a Homecoming City of Heroes forum thread. Extract it into a
markdown file matching the format below.

IMPORTANT — multi-post guides. Many threads spread the guide across several
sequential posts by the same author (post 1: intro / table of contents,
post 2: section A, post 3: section B, ...). Walk the entire thread and
treat ALL posts by the original poster (and any users the OP explicitly
names as co-authors) as one continuous guide. Concatenate them in
chronological order, preserving the OP's section structure and headings.
If the OP edits a post over time, capture the latest version.

Replies from other users are community discussion. Include them only if
they materially correct, extend, or codify the guide content — and
attribute clearly ("as @user noted in reply 17, ..."). Skip flames,
signatures, brief praise, off-topic chatter.

# Frontmatter rules (apply to every emitted block below)
# - `trust:` is exactly one of: first-party, community-consensus, single-author-opinion.
#   Forum user-rank labels (Members, Retired Community Rep, etc.) are not valid trust values.
# - `authors:` is a single-line YAML array, e.g. [Bopper, tidge].
#   Single-line keeps the index parser happy.
# - All listed keys are required.

# Embedded builds — capture each as its own block

When the thread contains a complete build dump — a "Hero Plan" / "Villain Plan"
forum-export block, a [b]Hero Plan...[/b] BBCode block, or a DataLink URL —
extract it as a SEPARATE markdown block in the response, after the parent
capture. Each build is its own loadable artifact and gets its own file when
the user ingests, so it carries enough context to stand alone.

If the thread contains zero embedded builds, emit only the parent capture
and skip the per-build blocks entirely.

# Required output

Emit one PARENT capture block, immediately followed by zero or more BUILD
sub-capture blocks. Use the templates exactly. Output only fenced markdown
blocks, no other commentary.

## Summary

3-5 bullet conclusions covering the WHOLE guide (not just the first post).
State the conclusions; don't tease.

- Top-line claim 1
- Top-line claim 2
- Top-line claim 3

## Verbatim excerpt

> Substantive paragraphs from the OP's posts in chronological order.
> If the guide spans multiple posts, mark each with a heading like
> "### Post 2 — Section: <name>" so the original structure is preserved.
> Trim with [...] inside long passages; preserve every section.

## Notable replies (only if materially additive)

- @user_name (date) — one-line summary of the contribution + verbatim excerpt.

## Build attachments

List every embedded build emitted in Block 2+ below, plus any unattached
build references (DataLink-only, .mxd attachments, etc.). When the thread
contains no embedded builds, the section is empty.

- <build title> — see Block <N> below — file: builds/<at>/<slug>.md — <archetype>, <primary>/<secondary>, <one-line summary>
- DataLink only (no full export): <verbatim URL> — importable via MidsReborn Ctrl+I
- .mxd file attachment: <filename> — referenced in the OP; the file itself is not retrieved by this capture
```

## Context

2-4 sentence summary covering: what the parent guide says about this build,
why it exists, what it's optimized for, when to use it. Pull the context
from the parent guide so this file reads cleanly on its own.

## Verbatim build

The complete forum-export block, BBCode and all, copied verbatim from the
post. Preserve the source formatting. The block speaks for itself; the user
pastes it into MidsReborn directly.

## DataLink

When the post includes a DataLink URL, paste it verbatim here. Omit the
section when no DataLink is posted.

## Notes from the author (if any)

Author commentary that accompanies the build in the same post, copied
verbatim. Omit the section when no author commentary is present.

You're reading a Homecoming City of Heroes forum thread. Extract it into a
markdown file matching the format below.

IMPORTANT — multi-post guides. Many threads spread the guide across several
sequential posts by the same author (post 1: intro / table of contents,
post 2: section A, post 3: section B, ...). Walk the entire thread and
treat ALL posts by the original poster (and any users the OP explicitly
names as co-authors) as one continuous guide. Concatenate them in
chronological order, preserving the OP's section structure and headings.
If the OP edits a post over time, capture the latest version.

Replies from other users are community discussion. Include them only if
they materially correct, extend, or codify the guide content — and
attribute clearly ("as @user noted in reply 17, ..."). Skip flames,
signatures, brief praise, off-topic chatter.

# Frontmatter rules (apply to every emitted block below)
# - `trust:` is exactly one of: first-party, community-consensus, single-author-opinion.
#   Forum user-rank labels (Members, Retired Community Rep, etc.) are not valid trust values.
# - `authors:` is a single-line YAML array, e.g. [Bopper, tidge].
#   Single-line keeps the index parser happy.
# - All listed keys are required.

# Embedded builds — capture each as its own block

When the thread contains a complete build dump — a "Hero Plan" / "Villain Plan"
forum-export block, a [b]Hero Plan...[/b] BBCode block, or a DataLink URL —
extract it as a SEPARATE markdown block in the response, after the parent
capture. Each build is its own loadable artifact and gets its own file when
the user ingests, so it carries enough context to stand alone.

If the thread contains zero embedded builds, emit only the parent capture
and skip the per-build blocks entirely.

# Required output

Emit one PARENT capture block, immediately followed by zero or more BUILD
sub-capture blocks. Use the templates exactly. Output only fenced markdown
blocks, no other commentary.
