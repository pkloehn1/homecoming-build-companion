# Rule: Use full IO set names in prose

**Status:** MUST. Applies to every word emitted in prose, frontmatter, lessons documents, summaries, headings, conversation responses, and code comments.
Abbreviations are tolerated **only** inside ```text``` fenced blocks holding a verbatim Mids forum-export.

## Why

The Mids forum-export shorthand (`SprScrStr`, `Hct`, `Arm`, `AchHee`, `FuroftheG`, etc.) is an artifact of the export format, not a documentation standard.
Prose is for humans (and for future Claude sessions) who read without the export reader's mental dictionary loaded.
"Superior Scrapper's Strike: Recharge/+50% Crit" is unambiguous; "SprScrStr-Rchg/+Crit" requires the reader to know the lookup.
Discoverability, searchability, and future-readability all improve with the full name.

## How to apply

- **Inside ```text``` code fences holding a verbatim Mids forum-export block:** keep abbreviations exactly as the export emits them. That's faithful reproduction of the format.
- **Everywhere else** (prose, frontmatter values, lessons docs, build-creation rules, summaries, conversation responses): full set name.
- **For procs:** "Achilles' Heel: Chance for Resistance Debuff" or "Fury of the Gladiator: Chance for -Res", not "AchHee-ResDeb%".
- **For uniques:** "Steadfast Protection: Resistance/+Defense", "Gladiator's Armor: TP Protection +3% Defense (All)", "Luck of the Gambler: Defense/Increased Global Recharge Speed".
- **When transcribing a build's slotting into prose,** translate every abbreviation to the full name even if the source build text used the shorthand.
  The verbatim ```text``` block stays verbatim; the prose translates.

When an abbreviation appears in a Mids forum-export source and the full name isn't in this table, look it up in [`data/canonical/boost_sets/`](../../data/canonical/boost_sets/).
The file name (snake-cased) and `display_name` field together resolve to the full set name.

## Reference

- [`error-output.md`](./error-output.md) — diagnostic messages also follow this rule (full names in messages).
- [`data/canonical/boost_sets/`](../../data/canonical/boost_sets/) — authoritative IO set composition and display names.
