"""The character-level schedule (``Database.Levels``) — slot-grant and power-pick levels.

The hard-limits validator checks that an added enhancement slot lands on a real
slot-grant level and that a power is picked at a real power-pick level. Both come
from the game's own level table (``Database.Levels``, one ``LevelMap`` per level),
dumped by the harness as ``levels.json`` — never a schedule reconstructed from
memory (:mod:`coh_engine.hard_limits`).

Level convention: the dump carries a 0-based ``LevelIndex`` (in-game level minus 1)
alongside the 1-based ``GameLevel``. Slot placement levels (``SlotRef.level``) and
power pick levels (``Power.pick_level``) are the same 0-based indices, so the
schedule is keyed on ``LevelIndex`` to compare against them directly.
