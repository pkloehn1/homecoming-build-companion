"""Hard game-limit validation (the P8 pre-flight) as a rule registry.

The Homecoming engine enforces invariant limits on every build: at most 67 added
enhancement slots, 5 added slots per power, 24 power picks, 4 power pools, and a
level/slot schedule that gates when a power may be picked and when a slot may be
placed (.claude/rules/hard-limits.md). This module checks all of them.

Built as a rule registry from birth (never an ``if/elif`` dispatch), mirroring
:mod:`coh_engine.legality`: a pre-built :class:`HardLimitsContext` walks the build
once, each ``@hard_limit_rule`` is a pure ``(context) -> Iterable[Diagnostic]``
function naming its own ``H-<DOMAIN>-<NN>`` codes, and the runner only composes.
Adding a limit is a new ``@hard_limit_rule``; it never edits the runner or a sibling
rule.

Every violation is an ``error`` (an invalid build), per :mod:`coh_engine.diagnostics`.
AT-cap adherence is *not* here — an over-cap total is game-clamped, not illegal, so it
stays a ``warning`` in :mod:`coh_engine.scoring` (the ``Totals``-vs-``TotalsCapped``
diff). This module owns only the structural invariants.

Level convention: ``Power.pick_level`` and ``SlotRef.level`` are 0-based level indices
(in-game level minus 1); a power's DB minimum ``Power.level`` is the 1-based in-game
level. The first-available check compares ``pick_level + 1`` against ``level``.
