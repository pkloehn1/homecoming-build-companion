"""Incarnate (Alpha-slot) enhancement — the GrantPower-delivered per-power fold.

An incarnate's real enhancement is **GrantPower-delivered**: the raw
``Incarnate.Alpha.*`` power carries only ``GrantPower``/``RevokePower``/``LevelShift``/
``SetMode``, and the actual Accuracy/RechargeTime/Defense/… enhancement lives on the
hidden granted sub-powers (``Effect.Summon`` / ``nSummon`` → ``db.Power[nSummon]``). The
harness resolves those sub-powers and dumps their ``Enhancement``/``DamageBuff`` effects
plus each sub-power's accept-gate class list as ``incarnates.json`` (see
``tools/mids-dump`` ``DumpBuildIncarnates``); this module applies them per target power,
reproducing ``GBPA_ApplyIncarnateEnhancements`` (clsToonX.cs:1393) **without** porting the
GrantPower absorption subsystem.

The apply, per target power ``powerMath`` and per granted sub-power ``sub``:

- **Accept-gate** (clsToonX.cs:1458): ``powerMath.Enhancements ∩ sub.Enhancements`` must be
    non-empty. The gate is the SUB-power's class list, not the Alpha's (which is empty).
- **Scalar aspects** (clsToonX.cs:1470-1495): ``ETModifies`` of Accuracy / EnduranceDiscount
    / RechargeTime (each gated by the target's ``IgnoreEnhancement``) and InterruptTime /
    Range (always) add the effect's magnitude to that per-power scalar's fold — the pre-ED
    term where ``IgnoreED`` is false, the post-ED term where true.
- **Effect-borne aspects** (``HandleDefaultIncarnateEnh``, clsToonX.cs:1291): every other
    ``ETModifies`` (Defense, Recovery, Endurance, …) adds the magnitude to each Buffable
    target effect whose ``EffectType == ETModifies`` (and ``DamageType`` matches, for
    Damage/Defense), as the same pre-ED / post-ED split folded into that effect's Math_Mag
    multiplier.

The ED-bypass the Alpha headline describes **is** the ``IgnoreED`` split: the DB stores each
aspect twice — an ``IgnoreED == false`` effect crushed together with slotted enhancement
(pre-ED) and an ``IgnoreED == true`` effect added at full value after ED (post-ED).

This module produces two addend maps; the numeric core (``statistics``, ``base_totals``)
looks them up and stays a literal Mids transcription (check-registry.md fidelity boundary):

- ``scalar[(build_index, aspect)] = (pre_ed, post_ed)`` — the recharge/end/interrupt/acc/
    range per-power scalar fold (``pre_ed`` co-EDs with slotted enhancement, ``post_ed`` is
    the ``fold_scalar`` ``post_ed_extra`` seam).
- ``effect[(build_index, effect_index)] = (pre_ed, post_ed)`` — the effect-mag addend, whose
    ``pre_ed`` co-EDs with the effect's slotted aggregate via ``aggregate_and_ed`` and whose
    ``post_ed`` is added after ED (``base_totals._compute_enh_multipliers``).

Both terms stay raw here: the pre-ED term is summed with the slotted aggregate BEFORE the
single ``ApplyED`` the consumer runs, exactly as Mids Pass1 accumulates the incarnate pre-ED
increment into the effect's ``Math_Mag`` alongside slotted enhancement before Pass2's one
``ApplyED`` (``ED(slotted + incarnatePreED)``, not ``ED(slotted) + ED(incarnatePreED)``). So a
target effect may carry both slotted and incarnate enhancement — no separate-ED divergence,
no co-slotting guard.
