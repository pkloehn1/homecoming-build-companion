"""Exemplar availability (+5 rule) and ForceLevel-gated recompute.

Two distinct concerns the checkpoint keeps separate:

- **Availability** — real-CoH's +5 rule: exemplared to level N, a character has
    every power (and slot) taken at level ``<= N + 5``. This is a build-authoring
    predicate; it does not enter the totals math.
- **ForceLevel gating** — how Mids recomputes totals at an exemplar level: set
    bonuses are gated on power pick ``Level <= ForceLevel`` and slot values on
    ``Slots.Level < ForceLevel``, with **no** ``set min - 3`` retention. The port
    already threads ``force_level`` through ``EngineConfig``; :func:`with_force_level`
    lowers it for a recompute. Mids retains a power's bonuses purely by pick level,
    so its exemplar totals are optimistic at deep exemplar versus live CoH — the
    port matches Mids (its reference), not live CoH.

Spec: docs/engine/mids-port-spec.md § set-bonuses-ruleof5 (the no--3 resolution);
.claude/rules/exemplar-10.md (the +5 availability rule).
