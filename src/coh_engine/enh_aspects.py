"""Per-aspect enhancement handlers — the ``eEnhance``-keyed registry for the scalar fold.

``GBPA_Pass3_EnhancePostED`` folds a per-power *scalar* aspect (recharge / endurance
discount / interrupt / accuracy / range) as ``base / (( ED(Σ slotted) + global ) + 1)``,
with recharge additionally clamped to the AT recharge cap. Every aspect follows that one
shape; only three things vary per aspect — its ED schedule (already keyed on the aspect
name in :func:`~coh_engine.enh_pipeline.schedule_for_enhance`), which global
``_selfEnhance`` term it adds (a field on :class:`~coh_engine.base_totals.GlobalEnhance`),
and whether it is capped.

This module centralises those facts as a registry keyed on the ``eEnhance`` aspect, so the
fold has a single registry-driven path instead of a hardcoded arm per aspect. The two
consumers — the per-power derived stats (:mod:`coh_engine.statistics`) and the character
toggle-EndUse arm (:mod:`coh_engine.base_totals`) — each already produce the ED-reduced
``Σ slotted`` aggregate their own way (inline vs. precomputed); this handler takes that
aggregate and supplies the per-aspect global term and cap. A new aspect is a new
``@_register`` entry (check-registry.md); the incarnate subsystem (CP5.1) plugs its
per-power enhancement into the same fold via the ``post_ed_extra`` seam (and a matching
pre-ED addend where the aggregate is produced), rather than special-casing each aspect.

Fidelity boundary: this is the *scalar* fold dispatch only. The effect-magnitude
enhancement path (``base_totals._compute_enh_multipliers`` / ``_enhance_aspect``), where
damage and typed defense/resistance are enhanced, stays a literal Mids transcription and
is **not** registry-ised.
